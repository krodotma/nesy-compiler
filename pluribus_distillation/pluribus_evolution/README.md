# pluribus_evolution

**The Secondary Trunk of the DNA (Dual Neurosymbolic Automata)**

This is the refinement/evolution trunk that observes, analyzes, and improves the primary `pluribus` trunk in perpetual balance.

## Architecture

```
pluribus_evolution/
├── observer/           # Watches pluribus primary
├── refiner/            # Proposes improvements
├── synthesizer/        # Generates refined code
├── bridge/             # Connects to primary trunk
└── specs/              # Protocol specifications
```

## Supersymmetry Principle

In production, there is no distinction between the primary and evolution trunks. Both are isomorphic—they can run the same code, access the same bus, and produce equivalent outcomes.

| Trunk | Role | Time Orientation |
|-------|------|------------------|
| pluribus (primary) | Execution | Present |
| pluribus_evolution (secondary) | Refinement | Past/Future |

## Capabilities

### Observer
- Code analysis and pattern detection
- Vector/manifold profiling
- Drift detection

### Refiner
- Refactoring proposals
- Manifold optimization
- Axiom evolution

### Synthesizer
- Code generation
- Test generation
- Documentation synthesis

### Bridge
- Bus mirroring
- Rhizome synchronization
- Cross-trunk coordination

## Protocol

See `specs/evolution_protocol_v1.md` for the full specification.

## Integration

This trunk integrates with:
- LASER (entropy synthesis)
- Rhizome (content-addressed storage)
- CMP (clade meta-productivity)
- Clade-Weave (neurosymbolic merging)
