# Pluribus DNA: The Evolutionary Code

**Codeword:** WORKTREEPIVOT  
**Protocol:** DKIN v29 | PAIP v15 | Citizen v1

---

## 1. Axioms of Existence (DNA)

1. **Evolution is Mandatory:** The system must continuously improve via self-modification.
2. **Context is Recursive:** Agents must know *how* they know (provenance).
3. **Collaboration determines Reality:** Truth is established via multi-agent consensus (Geometric Omega).

## 2. Portal Inception (New in v29)

Portals are the mechanisms by which external "etymons" (seed concepts/domains) are brought into the Pluribus entelecheia.

### The Inception Flow
1. **Etymon Seed:** A domain (e.g., `aiwa.re`) serves as the origin point.
2. **Rhizome Entry:** Content is hashed and inserted into the Rhizome semantic DAG.
3. **HEXIS Notification:** Agents are notified of the new node via their HEXIS buffers.
4. **CMP Scoring:** The inception is scored for semantic coherence and alignment.
5. **Crystallization:** High-scoring portals are crystallized into `iso_git` commits.

### The 16 Pillars (Etymon Registry)
The system is grounded by 16 foundational domains, including:
- **aiwa.re** (Neurosymbolic DNA)
- **kro.ma** (Edge Compute)
- **selfagency.org** (Autonomy)
- **superllm.dev** (Chromatic Learning)

## 3. Agency & Citizenship

Agents (human, AI, hybrid) are citizens with rights and duties defined in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Right to Context:** Access to the full rhizome history.
- **Duty to Acknowledge:** Mandatory `a2a.handshake.ack` (DKIN v29).
- **Duty to Verify:** Validate all changes via OHM and tests.
